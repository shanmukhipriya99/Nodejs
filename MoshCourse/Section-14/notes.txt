1) TDD -> Test-Driven Development
2) With TDD you write your tests before writing the production code
3) Steps involved:
    Write a failing test
    Write the simplest code to make the test pass
    Refactor if necessary
4) Benefits of TDD:
    testable source code
    full coverage by tests
    simpler implementation
5) beforeEach() is a function that contains common code that needs to be executed in many tests.
6) afterEach() is a function that contains common code that needs to be executed after many tests.
