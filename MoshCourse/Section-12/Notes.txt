1) Automated testing is the practice of writing code to test our code, and then run those tests in an automated fashion. 
   So, with automated testing, our source code consists of application code, which we also call production code and test code.
2) The most important benefit is that you can catch the bugs BEFORE deploying our application.
3) Refactoring means changing the structure of the code without changing its behaviour.
4) 3 types of tests: unit tests, integration tests and end-to-end tests. 
5) Unit test: You test a unit of the application without its external dependencies such as files, 
   databases, message queues, web services and so on.
   Tests a unit of an application without its external dependencies.
   Execute very fast
6) Integration test: An integration test, tests a class or a component with its external dependencies.
   Tests the application with its external dependencies.
   Take longer to execute
7) End-to-end test: drives an application through its user-interface.
   Very slow
8) Test framework gives us a library that includes a bunch of utility functions(for writing tests), test runner (executes the tests & gives reports) 
    ex: jasmine, mocha, jest
