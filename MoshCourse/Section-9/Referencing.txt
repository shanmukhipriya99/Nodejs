No RELATIONSHIPS in MongoDB! It's not an error to link to collections without a common entry.

Trade-off between query performance and consistency

1. Using References (Normalization) -> consistency
let author = {
	name: "Shanmukhi"
}
let course = {
	author: "id"
}

2. Using Embedded Documents (Denormalization) -> performance
let course = {
	author: {
	  name: "Shanmukhi"
	}
}

3. Hybrid
let author = {
	name: "Shanmukhi"
}
let course = {
	author: {
	  id: "ref"
	}
}
